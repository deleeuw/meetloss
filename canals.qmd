# Canonical Analysis and canals()

## Equations

If there are only two blocks the generalized eigenvalue problem for the Burt matrix becomes
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
D_1&C_{12}\\C_{21}&D_2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1\\a_2
\end{bmatrix}=2\lambda\begin{bmatrix}D_1&0\\0&D_2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
a_1\\a_2
\end{bmatrix},
$$
which we can rewrite as
$$
\begin{split}
C_{12}a_2&=(2\lambda-1)D_1a_1,\\
C_{21}a_1&=(2\lambda-1)D_2a_2,
\end{split}
$$
from which we see that MVAOS maximizes the sum of the $r$ largest canonical correlations between $H_1$ and $H_2$. See also @vandervelden_12.
